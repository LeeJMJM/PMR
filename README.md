# Physically Meaningful Regularization (PMR)
A kind of physical-knowledge-guided and interpretable CNNs for gear fault severity level diagnosis

## 1.	Statement
This method uses the class activation mapping (CAM) results of input spectra to regulate the training process of deep diagnostic models.
It can:

1) Improve the models' intepretability.
2) Enhance the models' anti-noise ability.

To use this dataset, please cite:

J. Li, X.-B. Wang, H. Chen, and Z.-X. Yang, “Physical-Knowledge-Guided and Interpretable Deep Neural Networks for Gear Fault Severity Level Diagnosis,” _IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics_, to be published.

## 2.	Method introduction
Here, a brief introduction of the proposed method is described.
